Baby Hotline, please hold me close to you 
Baby flatline, still time to do it too (ha-ha-ha!)
Baby snack time, chow down to earth
But in your head she's a
Hoarder of quarters
And no boundary boredom-dom
Boundary boredom! 

I contend that your drinking eye has never opened
I insist somebody will die, and I hate hoping
Wishing that the pills let you cry, and I hate coping
Someday I will go back outside and see her, okay
